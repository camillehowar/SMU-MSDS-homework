The unit 5 project consisted of various concepts related to data wrangling.  The project consisted of munging data to create summaries of the dataset and removing misspelled names.  THe data was also merged with another dataframe to create a comprehensive dataframe that focused on dispalying the top 10 rows by names of the children and summarizing the new data set by adding a total column, sorting the data by total and writing the top 10 girls to a CSV file
